Potion of Common Healing	A household essential. Weak healing potion.	A timeless recipe, used since the beginning of recorded history throughout the globe. Obviously now ibuprofens exist, but many old folks still insist that this “hits different”.	Nightshade + Solace Sage
20/20 Potion	Potion for better eyesight. Great contacts replacement.	A common recipe used throughout Eurasia. Though their effects are temporary, they don’t have any side effects unlike some other stronger, more permanent drugs for eyesight, making them a popular temporary replacement for lost glasses or forgotten contacts.	Nightshade + Cyclops Eye
Witch Hazel	Potion for hair growth and health. Silky smooooth.	It has long been a “public secret” in the beauty community that this is the potion all those beauty pageant queens and supermodels use right before they hit the stage. I mean, who doesn’t want buttery smooth hair?	Nightshade + Achia Seed
Good Vibes Potion	Good vibes only. Potion to improve mood.	Lying somewhere between serotonin and Sativa, this potion has always been a target of big pharma-lobbied politicians who feared that people will not buy commercial-grade antidepressants. Luckily, that never really came to pass.	Nightshade + Vampire Tears
Griffin Balm Potion	For Life’s Sore Spots. Potion for soreness and muscle pain.	They say that some balms give the strength and agility of a tiger. Guess what? Griffins can fly.	Nightshade + Griffin Claws
Melancholy Tonic	Sometimes you just gotta slow down. Strong depressant.	There are those moments where you just gotta slow down. This is the chill pill- but in a wrong mood, this can make you actually clinically depressed. It isn’t strong enough to be regulated at a personal level, however.	Solace Sage + Vampire Tears + Jormungandr Scales
Good Trip	Have a good trip! A powerful psychedelic.	Thankfully, just like LSD, this potion is non-addictive; its (relatively) low potency compared to the “real thing” and its widespread availability once caused a moral panic amongst the anti-drug parent’s associations. At least those died down a bit.	Cyclops Eye + Vampire Tears + Lightning in a Bottle
La Ganja Extravaganja	Let’s get sickening! A potent recreational drug.	Not a schedule 1 drug, thankfully. It did go dangerously close to being one for being too good at replicating the effects of THC, but at least in this country, it still remains legal- enough to consume it every day.	Solace Sage + Cyclops Eye + Vampire Tears + Jormungandr Scales
Sike Potion	A powerful potion of trickery and deceit. Please say sike right now.	A recipe lost to time and certain highly suspicious supernatural circumstances, this potion is to be treated with utmost care. This is not a mere neurotoxin or anesthesia; this goes way beyond that- a potion powerful enough to trick (even for a moment) the great gods.	Solace Sage + Griffin Claws + Jormungandr Scales + Lightning in a Bottle
Arnold Extract	Extremely powerful, but temporary, muscle steroid. Hasta la vista!	Too powerful for mere mortals, this potion was nicknamed after the only mortal being who was powerful enough to endure the effects of this concoction (it lasted 3 seconds). Deities and gods can make it last slightly longer, but sadly these are not permanent gainz.	Griffin claws + Lightning in a Bottle + Nightshade + Solace Sage
Panacea	The cure-all. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.	“Hey, this is just mixing all eight ingredients, this really has never been tried before?” Yes, it has, and every single time the One Above All interfered with its creation. Now, with the explicit permission and blessing of the One True God, you are allowed to create the ultimate wish of all alchemists.	Solace Sage + Cyclops Eye + Powdered Achia Seed + Vampire tears + Griffin claws + Jormungandr Scales + Nightshade + Lightning in a Bottle
